                  web design project.

                  When I have free time or go on vacation, I enjoy taking photographs. I bring my camera,
                  go for walks in various places, and strive to capture the beauty of nature and interesting moments.
                  Photography provides me with an opportunity to connect with the surrounding environment and share
                  stories through images.
